This repository contains all the in-house scripts and inputs for this publication: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.23.217992

All analyses were carried out in R version 3.5.1 (2018-07-02). Run *EnrichmentChromatinMarks_ChIC_OtherEnds.R* first as it loads all the libraries needed and the internal functions to run the scripts.

Inputs for HiC metaplots can be found in: https://osf.io/xpw8q/
